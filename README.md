# project-1_portfolio-website
This is a basic portfolio website I created as part of my learning journey in web development. It includes sections like Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact, along with social media links. The goal was to practice using HTML, CSS, and external resources like Google Fonts and Font Awesome for icons.

Please note that this is not my full or final portfolio. It was built purely for learning purposes, so the code is simplified and may not reflect all of my actual skills or work. Some parts are experimental and may be updated or improved as I continue to learn.

Through this project, I got hands-on experience with webpage structure, semantic tags, styling techniques, and responsive layouts. In the future, I plan to enhance the site with animations, improved responsiveness, and backend features like a working contact form.
